SimpleDOM, a PHP wrapper for SimpleXML and the DOM classes
==========================================================

It is messy to work with XML dom structures in PHP. Most things are handled
by SimpleXML, but sometimes the various DOM classes must be used instead.
SimpleDOM does most of this transparently, so you don't have to think about it.

The code is originally a fork from https://code.google.com/p/simpledom/, with
changes and additions by Textalk.
